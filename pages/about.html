        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        I am Serhet, a Mathematical Engineering student at Yildiz Technical University. I am interested in both data science and software engineering.
        <br><br>
        I have developed myself in Python, C, C++, C# and SQL, by using these languages in data analysis, algorithm development, and software engineering projects. I thrive in transforming raw data into meaningful insights, while also designing and implementing efficient software solutions. Whether working on data-driven applications or tackling complex computational challenges, I aim to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering.   
        <br><br>
        With hands-on experience in various projects, I believe I am ready to explore new technologies and methodologies that enhance both performance and scalability. My approach is meticulous, detail-oriented, and driven by a deep curiosity for solving real-world problems through data and code.
