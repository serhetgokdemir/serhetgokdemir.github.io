                <h1>Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews: A Comprehensive NLP Approach</h1>
                <p>This project demonstrates the use of a machine learning pipeline to classify movie reviews as positive or negative sentiments. The pipeline includes:</p><p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Text Preprocessing, Model Development, Dockerized Training and Inference.</p><p></p><p>The project showcases practical applications like customer feedback analysis, social media sentiment tracking, and review moderation for businesses.</p>

                <h1>Building Neural Networks and Custom Convolutions: Deep Learning Techniques</h1>
                <p>This project explores the foundational techniques of deep learning, including neural network construction and custom convolution operations. It begins with implementing a classification task using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, highlighting the development of custom architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and training scripts.</p><p>In the second phase, I developed 1D and 2D convolution functions from scratch, applied them to signal and image data. The 1D convolution function was used to denoise a sine wave. The 2D convolution function was applied to grayscale and RGB images by using the effects of blurring and Sobel operator-based edge detection.<i><a href="https://github.com/serhetgokdemir/neural-networks-deep-learning" target=_blank">Click here to see the project on Github.</a></i>

                <h1>Bank Marketing with Social and Economic Concept Through Data Analysis</h1>
                <p>In this project, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preparation (DP) on bank marketing data to uncover key patterns and relationships within the dataset. Through univariate and multivariate analyses, I visualized feature distributions and investigated correlations, preparing the data for further analysis. I then applied multiple dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA and t-SNE, to distill the complexity of data while retaining essential information. This process offers insights into the data structure and provides a streamlined foundation for future predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making.<i><a href="https://github.com/serhetgokdemir/eda-bankmarketing" target=_blank">Click here to see the project on Github.</a></i>
