                <h1>Building Neural Networks and Custom Convolutions: Deep Learning Techniques</h1>
                <p>This project explores the foundational techniques of deep learning, including neural network construction and custom convolution operations.<br><br>It begins with implementing a classification task using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, highlighting the development of custom architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and training scripts.</p><p>In the second phase, 1D and 2D convolution functions have developed from scratch, applied to signal and image data. The 1D convolution function was used to denoise a sine wave. The 2D convolution function was applied to grayscale and RGB images by using the effects of blurring and Sobel operator-based edge detection.<i><a href="https://github.com/serhetgokdemir/neural-networks-deep-learning" target=_blank">Click here to see the project on Github.</a></i>
