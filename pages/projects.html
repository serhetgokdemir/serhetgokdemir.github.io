                <h1>Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews: A Comprehensive NLP Approach</h1>
                <p>This project demonstrates the use of a machine learning pipeline to classify movie reviews as positive or negative sentiments. It combines data science techniques such as text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation with machine learning engineering (MLE) best practices, including Dockerization for modularity and reproducibility. The pipeline includes:</p><p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed sentiment distribution, review lengths, and missing values, revealing a balanced dataset with insightful word frequency patterns.</p><p>Text Preprocessing: Applied tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF) to prepare the text data for modeling.</p><p>Model Development: Experimented with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The optimized SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 89.00%.</p><p>Dockerized Training and Inference: The training stage prepares and saves the best-performing model in a structured directory. The inference stage uses the trained model to generate predictions on unseen data, storing results in a CSV file.</p><p>The project showcases practical applications like customer feedback analysis, social media sentiment tracking, and review moderation for businesses.</p>

                <h1>Building Neural Networks and Custom Convolutions: Deep Learning Techniques</h1>
                <p>This project explores the foundational techniques of deep learning, including neural network construction and custom convolution operations. It begins with implementing a classification task using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, highlighting the development of custom architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and training scripts.</p><p>In the second phase, I developed 1D and 2D convolution functions from scratch, applying them to signal and image data. The 1D convolution function was used to denoise a sine wave, demonstrating the impact of kernel size on smoothing noisy signals. The 2D convolution function was applied to grayscale and RGB images, showcasing the effects of blurring and Sobel operator-based edge detection.<i><a href="https://github.com/serhetgokdemir/neural-networks-deep-learning" target=_blank">Click here to see the project on Github.</a></i>

                <h1>Bank Marketing with Social and Economic Concept Through Data Analysis</h1>
                <p>In this project, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preparation (DP) on bank marketing data to uncover key patterns and relationships within the dataset. Through univariate and multivariate analyses, I visualized feature distributions and investigated correlations, preparing the data for further analysis. I then applied multiple dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA and t-SNE, to distill the complexity of data while retaining essential information. This process offers insights into the data structure and provides a streamlined foundation for future predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making.<i><a href="https://github.com/serhetgokdemir/eda-bankmarketing" target=_blank">Click here to see the project on Github.</a></i>
